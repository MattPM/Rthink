# Questions 

What would you uadjust for in this example? 

predicting osteoclast frequency as a function of age? 

basically it depends on sex and age. Age mediates its effects through sex which mediates its effect through estrogen, but age doesn't *cause* sex obviously. 
sex causes higher basal level of E so has a direct effect.

I dont really get this. 

```{r}
dag.ex <- dagitty( "dag {
    S -> E  
    S -> A
    A -> E -> O
    S -> E <- A
}")
drawdag(dag.ex)
adjustmentSets( dag.ex , exposure= "A" , outcome="O" )

```
