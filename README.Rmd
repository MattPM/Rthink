This repository contains my own personal notes, code, and code to work through examples and problem sets for the textbook [Statistical Rethinking - *A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)" by Richard Mcelreath. This repository is not endorsed by anyone affiliated with the textbook they are simply notes.
