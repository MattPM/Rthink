This repository contains my own personal notes, code, and code to work
through examples and problem sets for the textbook [Statistical
Rethinking - *A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and
Stan*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)" by Richard
Mcelreath. This repository is not endorsed by anyone affiliated with the
textbook they are simply notes.
